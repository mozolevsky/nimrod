                            <p>The Body Transformation Nutrition Plan contains just 9 simple guidelines to help you transform your diet and therefore, your body. Use these guidelines to help you change the way you look at food. Food is fuel that will help give you the energy you need to accomplish your goals both inside and outside of the gym. Food is no longer the enemy, and instead the Body Transformation Nutrition Plan will help you embrace healthy foods and healthy habits from now on.</p>

                            <p>The 9 guidelines will also help balance your hormones, which may be out of whack due to inconsistent meal planning and an overabundance of refined carbohydrates. A diet high in refined carbohydrates spike insulin levels and signal the body to gain fat. Once on the Body Transformation Meal Plan, your body will start to tap into fat stores to use as fuel.</p>
